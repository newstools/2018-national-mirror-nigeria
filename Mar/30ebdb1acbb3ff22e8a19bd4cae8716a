Gunmen suspected to be herdsmen on Monday killed ten people, including a traditional ruler, in separate attacks on the eastern part of Kogi State. The Onu of Agbenema, Musa Edibo, and his wife, were reportedly burnt in his palace. According to reports, many houses were set ablaze. The attacks took place in Agbenema, Ajichekpa, Opada and Iyade villages, in Omala area. Reacting to the incident, former Majority Leader, Kogi State House of Assembly, Azania Mohammed, said the natives were not sure if they should approach or call on the security operatives for help. The armed attackers were said to have hidden in bushes around the villages from were they launched attacks on their targets. “We were surprised when we approached the soldiers who were stationed at the Guest House at Abejukolo, for assistance. They refused to act professionally as they used their vehicle to block us from advancing to the troubled spot to help our people,” a resident said. “It is clear that the aim of the Fulani herdsmen is to kill us and take over our ancestral homes. They have razed down Ojuwo, Ajomayeigbi, Iyade, Agbenema and Opada villages, so that they could use our land for their cattle colonies. “We want the world to come to our assistance before these Fulanis exterminate and inherit our land. We have lost confidence in the security agencies posted to us. “We believe they have been instructed to adopt ‘siddon look’, while we are being massacred.  “Right now, cordinated war is raging simultaneously in most villages in Omala, Dekina and Bassa LGAs. Our people are being killed and houses burnt even as our women are being raped while many children who ran from the theatre of war are still missing,” the resident added.
