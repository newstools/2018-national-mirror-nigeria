The Sun says gave Pogba a dressing down after the French star interrupted a TV interview he was giving. Pogba has not started either of Manchester United’s two games since the incident following their 2-1 victory over Liverpool on March 10. Mourinho was being interviewed by Match of the Day when Pogba sneaked up and clasped his hand, pulling the United manager to him. While Mourinho tried to laugh it off at the time, he was furious with his £89million midfielder and told him so afterwards. Pogba may have been trying to show publicly there were no hard feelings between him and his boss but Mourinho saw his antics as disrespectful in front of the TV cameras.
