The largest social network, of course, Facebook has been under fire and many have abandoned it. After the giant Mozilla announced that it would stop advertising on the social network giant Facebook, now it was Elon Musk’s turn to erase Tesla’s and SpaceX’s Facebook pages. The challenge came from a Twitter user and Elon Musk did not disappoint that user, hence, as a result, Elon Musk deleted all its companies’ pages from the social network giant Facebook’s platform. It’s a case to say “Told and Done”! After a “teaser” of a Twitter user, Elon Musk even deleted the Facebook pages relating to SpaceX and Tesla. As, the multimillionaire, of course, Elon Musk joins the “#deletefacebook” movement.
Delete SpaceX page on Facebook if you’re the man?

Elon Musk vs Mark Zuckerberg Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are not exactly best friends. In 2017 Elon Musk reported that Mark Zuckerberg was very irresponsible in the way he approached artificial intelligence. Musk had also mentioned that he was not a fan of the world’s largest social network, of course, Facebook and therefore had no profile. Regarding company pages, Musk stated that since he does not advertise on Facebook, he does not consider it serious that they are not there. Interestingly Musk did not even know that company pages existed on Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg has asked, more than once, apologies for the scandal involving Cambridge Analityca. However, there are those who have even stopped using the largest social network and certainly there will be more “names of big personalities” to do so. It should be noted that everything happened after it was revealed that more than 50 million users were used, whose data were improperly obtained. Later, these data were used to manipulate information in the American elections.
